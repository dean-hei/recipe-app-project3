# Project Evolution

### 1st Day - Thursday, March 13

Project began on day of team selection announcements. Last day of in campus instruction prior to moving to remote classes. Spent the day on decoupled app code-along, a functional team planning workshop - as well as installing Zoom for the upcoming remote classes. Our team began discussing ideas and making plans for the coming week.

### 2nd and 3rd Days - Saturday and Sunday, March 14th & March 15th

We made a final decision on idea - a No Scroll Recipe App that would allow users to see an entire recipe without scrolling. Users would able to save recipes and favorite recipes, share recipes, etc. Dean showed the team some initial wireframes.
